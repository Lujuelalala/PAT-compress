# PAT-compress
You can use this compress script to compress your pattern files efficiently, freeing up more resources and improving productivity. When running this script, make sure that your python interpreter has a dependency on re.
Add the original file path and file name you want to compress to the script, and a new file will be generated to save the compressed content at the end of the run. For example, the original file 'D:\\test.txt' and the output file 'D:\\output.txt'
